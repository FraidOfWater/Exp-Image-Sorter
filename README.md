# Simple-Image-Sorter
Sorts images into destination files. Written in python. I got really sick of organising my character art and meme folders by hand.
The UI is basic but functional, someone better at TKinter than I am could improve it though.

## USE
- Make sure all your files that you want to sort are in some kind of directory/folder already, they can be in folders within that folder, that's fine.
-- (There is an 'exclusions' function where you can list folder names to ignore.
- Within a new or existing folder, create your new organisational structure, _for example:_
```
Pictures
├ Family
├ Holiday
├ Wedding
├ My stuff
├ Misc
```
- Select your new root folder ("Pictures", in the above example) as the ``'destination'``, and the folder that contains all the existing pictures you want to sort as the ``source``. Note these *cannot* be the same folder. They must be different structures.
- Press sort, and sort away!
There are hotkeys and buttons for the folders to sort into, which are essentially your categories, and you can customise hotkeys (though you'll need to restart the program).
